<!--            <div>-->
<!--                <h3>This system is intended to accomplish three main goals:</h3>-->
<!--                <p><h4>1. Make a Legend of Zelda RPG, not a Legend of Zelda flavored RPG :</h4> The core mission statement of this system is to make a game that captures the characteristic style of gameplay that the Legend of Zelda video games are known for. This primarily entails a central emphasis on acquired items as the primary determiner of character capabilities, and a prominent presence of puzzles requiring specific items to solve. Combat, particularly boss battles, should have a puzzle-like aspect as well. And of course, all the classic LoZ items and races and such should be represented for use in games. It's not sufficient to merely have a system capable of incorporating these elements; it should be specifically geared to promote a uniquely and recognizably Legend-of-Zelda style of play.</p>-->
<!--                <p><h4>2. Synthesize and expand on the video games, don't merely replicate them :</h4> While emulating the characteristic style of the Zelda games is the #1 priority, that doesn't mean we should limit ourselves to only the things you can do in those games. Any archetype that would reasonably fit into any of the Zelda settings should be feasible; not all PCs will be Hylian sword-and-boarders. The beauty of pen-and-paper RPGs is that they aren't limited by the same technical constraints that bind video games, and the Zelda series has very rich settings with lots stuff to work with; we should be free to let our imaginations run a bit wild. Likewise, unless it would add excessive complexity to the core of the system or threatens to render an item utterly redundant, there's no harm in allowing characters to do things that should reasonably be possible but can't be done in the video games. (It's important to note here that even if an item's original purpose in a given game is rendered moot by allowing a certain action, that doesn't mean the item can't be slightly adapted to still have a purpose. For instance, it would be reasonable to allow all characters to swim, barring conflicting racial traits such as a Goron's density, but that doesn't mean you can't still have a use for stuff like the Zora's Flippers or Zora Armor.)</p>-->
<!--                <p><h4>3. Simplicity and Accessibility :</h4> We want this game to be easy to learn and easy to play, even for Zelda fans who've never played a tabletop game before. Of course, there is a point of diminishing returns where trimming down the rules hurts the system's robustness more than it improves ease of use, and we want to avoid that, but as a rule of thumb, keep it simple.</p>-->
